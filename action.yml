  vim_version:
    description: |-
      Version of Vim.
      The meaning of this value depends on `vim_type` and `download`.

      `head` is always head version:
      When `download` is enabled, this points head release.
      When `download` is not enabled, this points master of repository.

      When `download` is enabled and specified a semver such as `v8.2.0000`, this action finds a minimum version that is higher than a specified version.
      For example:
      When there are some released versions: `v8.2.0052` `v8.2.0057` `v8.2.0065`
      And when a specified version is `v8.2.0055`, `v8.2.0057` is actually selected.

    required: false
    default: 'head'
  vim_type:
    description: |-
      Type of Vim.
      This is one of `vim`, `neovim`, or `macvim`.
    required: false
    default: 'vim'
  gui:
    description: |-
      When this is `yes`, setups the GUI version.
      And `outputs.executable` points to GUI version of Vim.
    required: false
    default: 'no'
  arch:
    description: |-
      Architecture of Vim.
      This is either of `x86_64` or `x86`, enable when `vim_type` is `vim` on Windows.
    required: false
    default: 'x86_64'
  download:
    description: |-
      When this is `always`, downloads the officially released binary, or fail if unavailable.
      When this is `available`, downloads the officially released binary if available, otherwise builds from source code.
      When this is `never`, always builds from source code.
    required: false
    default: 'available'
  cache:
    description: |-
      When this is `true`(default), cache the built Vim.

      This uses same caching mechanism from actions/cache.
      Therefore, this consumes the limitation of cache size.
      https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#usage-limits-and-eviction-policy

      This is automatically disabled when `download` is enabled.
    required: false
    default: 'true'
